# Project: Infrastructure as Code for a Secure Serverless AI Workload on AWS

This workshop is a DevOps and Cloud Engineering project that uses AI document summarizer as the vehicle to teach secure serverless architecture, Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD automation, and observability on AWS.

In this workshop build as a serverless document summarization platform. The platform accepts long-form text documents through a secured REST API and returns AI-generated summaries powered by Amazon Bedrock.

There are four core components that work together to process a request end to end: Amazon Cognito, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon Bedrock. Each component has a distinct role in the request pipeline, from authentication through to AI inference.

+ **Amazon Cognito** — Manages user sign-up, login, and JWT token issuance through a Hosted UI, so your API never has to handle passwords directly.
+ **Amazon API Gateway** — Sits in front of your compute layer, validating every JWT token and enforcing a usage plan with an API key before any request reaches your code.
+ **AWS Lambda** — Processes verified requests, calls Amazon Bedrock for AI summarization, and reads/writes to DynamoDB. Runs only when invoked, and scales to zero when idle.
+ **Amazon Bedrock** — Generates the actual text summary using the Amazon Nova Lite foundation model, called via a cross-region inference profile.

You will also build the infrastructure that core pipeline was recently use for product. Terraform for repeatable infrastructure, a CodePipeline CI/CD pipeline with automated tests and a manual approval gate, CloudWatch monitoring with a real firing alarm, and a CIS-aligned security baseline.
