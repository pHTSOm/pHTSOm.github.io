{{% notice warning %}}
**This deletes data permanently.** `terraform destroy` drops the DynamoDB table and the Cognito user pool outright: every stored summary and every registered user is gone, with no way to recover them. Point-in-time recovery does not survive the table being deleted, and no final snapshot is taken. If you need any of it for a report or a demo, export it before you start.

#### Teardown Order 

Terraform generally handles dependency order automatically, but a few AWS resources block deletion until a manual precondition is met — regardless of what Terraform tries to do. Two matter most here:

- **S3 buckets must be empty before they can be destroyed**, unless the bucket resource sets force_destroy = true. A bucket containing objects will fail to delete with BucketNotEmpty otherwise.
- **CloudFront distributions must be disabled before the underlying origin (the S3 bucket) can be safely removed**, and a distribution itself must finish disabling before it can be deleted.

Getting the order wrong doesn't corrupt anything — it just means terraform destroy will fail partway through, and needs to be re-run after resolving the blocker.

#### Which Buckets Actually Need Manual Emptying

Only one of the four S3 buckets in this project sets force_destroy = true: the CI/CD artifacts bucket (modules/pipeline), since build artifacts are disposable by design. The other three do not, and will fail terraform destroy if anything is inside them:

| Bucket | Module | force_destroy | Manual empty required? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frontend static files | modules/frontend | not set | Yes |
| Weekly reports | modules/data | not set | Yes |
| CloudTrail + Config logs | modules/security | not set | Yes |
| Pipeline artifacts | modules/pipeline | true | No — destroys cleanly even with objects inside |

None of the four buckets have S3 versioning enabled, so there are no old object versions or delete markers to worry about when emptying them. The remote state bucket is a separate, manually-bootstrapped bucket outside this Terraform configuration entirely, so terraform destroy never touches it. You still created it for this project, so it is torn down by hand in Step 6 once everything else is gone.

#### Step 1 — Empty the Three Non-Force-Destroy Buckets

Do this before running terraform destroy, for the frontend bucket, the reports bucket, and the security logs bucket:

1. **S3** console → select the bucket → **Empty**.
2. Type permanently delete to confirm.
3. Repeat for all three buckets in the table above. The pipeline artifacts bucket can be skipped — force_destroy handles it automatically.

#### Step 2 — Disable the CloudFront Distribution

1. **CloudFront** console → select the distribution .
2. Click **Disable**.
3. Wait for **Status** to change from **Deploying** to **Disabled**.

#### Step 3 — Run Terraform Destroy

With the three buckets empty and CloudFront disabled, destroy the infrastructure:

```bash
cd terraform
AWS_PROFILE=YOUR-PROFILE terraform plan -destroy
```

Review the plan — confirm every resource listed is expected to be destroyed and nothing looks out of place.

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=YOUR-PROFILE terraform destroy
```

Type yes when prompted.

If this is run through the CI/CD pipeline rather than locally, the same manual approval gate applies — review the destroy plan before approving it, exactly as you would review an apply plan.

#### Step 4 — Manual Leftovers Terraform Won't Catch

The summarizer and report Lambda log groups are explicitly defined as aws_cloudwatch_log_group resources in modules/compute and modules/scheduling, so terraform destroy removes /aws/lambda/doc-summarizer-fn and /aws/lambda/doc-summarizer-report along with everything else — no manual step needed for those two. What genuinely survives destroy:

- **CodeBuild log groups** — the aws_codebuild_project resources in modules/pipeline don't have a matching aws_cloudwatch_log_group resource, so CodeBuild creates its log group implicitly on first run and Terraform never tracks or destroys it. Check **CloudWatch → Log groups** and manually delete any leftover /aws/codebuild/doc-summarizer-* groups.
- **Cognito domain prefix** — the domain prefix you set in `cognito_domain_prefix` is released when aws_cognito_user_pool_domain is destroyed, but can take a few minutes to become available again. If re-running this workshop from scratch, confirm the prefix is actually free before attempting to recreate it.
- **CloudTrail multi-region trail state** — CloudTrail can take a short delay to fully stop logging after its Terraform resource is destroyed; a trailing event or two after teardown is normal.
- **AWS Config conformance pack** — the CIS pack in modules/security is the slowest resource in this stack to delete, often taking ten minutes or more. Terraform deletes the pack before the recorder and delivery channel because of the dependency chain, but the API call frequently times out first. This is the most likely thing to stall a destroy run. If it does, confirm under **Config → Conformance packs** that the pack is actually gone, then re-run terraform destroy. If the pack is stuck in DELETE_FAILED, delete it from the console and re-run.

#### Step 5 — Verify $0 Forward Run-Rate

1. Open **Billing and Cost Management** → **Cost Explorer**.
2. Filter to the last 24–48 hours, grouped by service.
3. Confirm no service shows an active, ongoing cost — a small trailing charge from the last few hours before teardown is expected, but nothing should show new activity after the destroy completed.
4. Cross-check against the resource list:

```bash
aws lambda list-functions --profile YOUR-PROFILE --query 'Functions[?starts_with(FunctionName, `doc-summarizer`)]'
aws dynamodb list-tables --profile YOUR-PROFILE --query 'TableNames[?starts_with(@, `SummarizerTable`)]'
aws s3 ls --profile YOUR-PROFILE | grep doc-summarizer | grep -v tfstate
aws cognito-idp list-user-pools --max-results 20 --profile YOUR-PROFILE --query 'UserPools[?starts_with(Name, `doc-summarizer`)]'
```

All of these should return empty results ([] or no matching lines).

The `grep -v tfstate` on the bucket check matters. The remote state bucket is also named with the `doc-summarizer` prefix, and it is still in use at this point, so without that filter the command reports a leftover bucket even after a completely successful destroy. Step 6 removes it.

#### Step 6 — Remove the Remote State Backend

The state bucket and the DynamoDB lock table were created by hand before the first terraform apply, so nothing in the configuration deletes them. Do this **last**, only after Step 5 confirms everything else is gone. Once the state bucket is deleted, terraform can no longer read the state file, so this is a one-way door.

The state bucket has versioning enabled. `aws s3 rm --recursive` deletes the current objects but leaves every previous version behind, and the bucket will still refuse to delete. Emptying it from the **S3 console** is the reliable path, because the console's **Empty** action removes versions and delete markers too.

1. **S3** console → select the state bucket → **Empty** → type `permanently delete` → then **Delete** the bucket itself.
2. **DynamoDB** console → **Tables** → select the lock table → **Delete**.

```bash
aws s3 ls --profile YOUR-PROFILE | grep doc-summarizer
aws dynamodb list-tables --profile YOUR-PROFILE
```

Both should now come back empty. At this point every resource this project created is gone.

#### Final Verification Checklist

- [ ] Cognito domain prefix released
- [ ] AWS Config conformance pack fully deleted, not stuck in DELETE_FAILED
- [ ] Cost Explorer shows no new activity after teardown
- [ ] CLI list commands return empty for Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and Cognito
- [ ] Remote state bucket emptied and deleted, DynamoDB lock table deleted (Step 6)

#### Common Destroy Failures and Fixes

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| BucketNotEmpty | One of the three non-force-destroy buckets (frontend, reports, security logs) still contains objects | Repeat Step 1 for the specific bucket named in the error |
| DependencyViolation on the CloudFront distribution's origin | Distribution wasn't fully disabled before destroy ran | Repeat Step 2, wait for status **Disabled** before retrying terraform destroy |
| Cognito user pool domain fails to delete | Domain still attached to the app client's Hosted UI configuration | Remove the domain association from the app client first, or destroy in this order: app client → domain → user pool |
| terraform destroy hangs or times out on aws_config_conformance_pack | Conformance pack deletion is slow and regularly exceeds the API timeout | Wait, confirm under **Config → Conformance packs** whether it actually deleted, then re-run terraform destroy. Delete it from the console if it is stuck in DELETE_FAILED |
| State bucket refuses to delete with BucketNotEmpty after aws s3 rm --recursive | The state bucket has versioning enabled, and old versions plus delete markers are still present | Empty it from the S3 console instead, which removes versions and delete markers as well |
| terraform destroy partially completes, then fails | One resource blocked deletion (any of the above), leaving dependent resources undestroyed | Fix the specific blocker, then re-run terraform destroy — it's safe to re-run, it only acts on resources still present in state |
